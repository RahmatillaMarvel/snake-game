# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game!

## Introduction
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. In this game, you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with its own body and the game borders.

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file.
2. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake:
   - Up arrow: Move the snake upwards
   - Down arrow: Move the snake downwards
   - Left arrow: Move the snake to the left
   - Right arrow: Move the snake to the right
3. Guide the snake to eat the food items (blue circles) that appear randomly on the screen.
4. As the snake eats food, it grows longer.
5. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game borders.
6. Try to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can!
